# task-manager

This project is being developed for parents and their children. The idea is to give parents the ability to remotely monitor whether their children at home are completing their daily duties. 
Children can also complete daily tasks (such as tidying up toys, making their bed, etc.) in an entertainment way and send parents a photo report. Tasks will be divided into daily (routine) and special tasks.
